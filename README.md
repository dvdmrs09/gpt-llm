Gemma 7b-it Model Integration Scripts README
This README provides an overview of various Python scripts developed for integrating and working with the Gemma 7b-it model. These scripts range from basic sample usage to enhanced versions with concurrency and a final unified approach for generating rewrite prompts, both with a remotely hosted and a locally hosted Gemma 7b-it model.

Scripts Overview
1. sample.py
Purpose: Demonstrates a basic example of interacting with the Gemma 7b-it model API for generating rewrite prompts from input text.
Key Features: Basic API call setup and result handling.
2. unified.py
Purpose: Combines different functionalities into a single script, allowing for both model fine-tuning (using Axolotl) and prompt generation (using Medusa decoding).
Key Features: Incorporates command-line interface (CLI) functionalities for user inputs, model training and fine-tuning, and rewrite prompt generation.
3. local.py
Purpose: Optimized for interaction with a Gemma 7b-it model instance hosted locally. This version assumes a simpler setup without the need for API key authentication.
Key Features: Simplified API interactions targeting a locally hosted model, and removed authentication steps necessary for cloud-hosted services.
4. enhanced.py
Purpose: Offers an improved structure and additional error handling over sample.py, including more detailed documentation and logging.
Key Features: Better error handling, logging, and documentation for easier debugging and code maintenance.
5. enhanced-con.py
Purpose: Introduces concurrency to the basic script to handle larger datasets more efficiently by generating rewrite prompts in parallel.
Key Features: Implements concurrent.futures for parallel processing, improving performance on large datasets.
6. final.py
Purpose: A culmination of previous scripts' features, providing a comprehensive and flexible tool for both training (locally or remotely) and generating rewrites with the Gemma 7b-it model, including settings for using a locally hosted instance.
Key Features: Combines Axolotl training, Medusa decoding, concurrency, local and remote API interaction, error handling, and user configurability through CLI arguments.
Usage
Each script is designed for specific scenarios and offers different functionalities. To run any of the scripts, Python 3.6 or newer is required, along with additional dependencies such as requests, concurrent.futures, and argparse which may be installed using pip:

pip install requests argparse
General Syntax:

python <script_name>.py --data_path "<input_dataset.json>" --output_path "<output_file.json>" [other optional arguments]
Replace <script_name>.py with the name of the script you wish to execute, and adjust the command-line arguments as needed based on the script's documentation and purpose.

Dependencies
Python 3.6+
requests: For making API calls.
concurrent.futures: For implementing concurrency (parallel processing).
argparse: For parsing command-line arguments.
logging: For logging messages and errors.
pandas and json: For data manipulation and serialization.
tqdm: For progress bars in scripts that support concurrency.
Ensure all dependencies are installed to avoid runtime errors. Some scripts may require additional setup, such as configuring local API endpoints or obtaining API keys for cloud services.

Contribution
Contributions to improve or expand the capabilities of these scripts are welcome. Please follow the standard fork-pull request workflow for contributions. Ensure to follow coding standards and include documentation for any new features or changes.

License
Specify the license under which these scripts are released, ensuring users are aware of their rights and limitations in using and modifying the code.
