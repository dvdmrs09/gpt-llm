BeginnersGuidePython WikiSource: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) Beginner's Guide to PythonNew to programming? Python is free and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.Chinese Translation/\u4e2d\u6587\u7248\u5165\u95e8(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuideChinese) New to Python?Read BeginnersGuide/Overview(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Overview) for a short explanation of what Python is. Getting PythonNext, install the Python 3 interpreter on your computer. This is the program that reads Python programs and carries out their instructions; you need it before you can do any Python programming. Mac and Linux distributions may include an outdated version of Python (Python 2), but you should install an updated one (Python 3). See BeginnersGuide/Download(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for instructions to download the correct version of Python.There are also Python interpreter and IDE bundles available, such as Thonny(http://thonny.org/). Other options can be found at IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments(https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments).At some stage, you'll want to edit and save your program code. Take a look at HowToEditPythonCode(https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowToEditPythonCode) for some advice and recommendations. Learning PythonNext, read a tutorial and try some simple experiments with your new Python interpreter.If you have never programmed before, see BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) for a list of suitable tutorials.If you have previous programming experience, consult BeginnersGuide/Programmers(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers), which lists more advanced tutorials.If English isn't your first language, you might be more comfortable with a tutorial that's been translated into your language. Consult python.org's list of NonEnglish resources(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Languages).Most tutorials assume you know how to run a program on your computer. If you are using Windows and need help with this, see How do I Run a Program Under Windows(http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/howdoirunapythonprogramunderwindows).Here are some sites that focus on beginners and offer inbrowser coding:Beginners Python tutorial(https://python.land/pythontutorial) at Python Land (free)Cod\u00e9dex(https://www.codedex.io/python) (nonfree)<!>Coding Bootcamps(https://www.codingbootcamps.com/) (nonfree)DataCamp(https://www.datacamp.com/) (nonfree)Dataquest(https://www.dataquest.io/) for Python for data science.

It includes a tutorial(http://docs.python.org/tut/) that might come in handy, a Library Reference(http://docs.python.org//lib/) that lists all of the modules that come standard with Python, and the Language Reference(http://docs.python.org/ref/) for a complete (if rather dry) explanation of Python's syntax.When you are ready to write your first program, you will need a text editor(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors) or an IDE(https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments). If you don't want to use Thonny or something more advanced, then you can use IDLE(https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html), which is bundled with Python and supports extensions(http://idlex.sourceforge.net/).This Python wiki also contains"}

It is often compared(https://wiki.python.org/moin/LanguageComparisons) (favorably of course !:)(https://wiki.python.org/wiki/europython/img/smile.png :)) ) to Lisp, Tcl, Perl, Ruby, C, Visual Basic, Visual Fox Pro, Scheme or Java... and it's much more fun.Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various windowing systems(https://wiki.python.org/moin/GUI%20Programming%20in%20Python). New builtin modules are easily written in C or C++ (or other languages, depending on the chosen implementation(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations)).

Read BeginnersGuide/Help(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Help) for mailing lists and newsgroups.Most Python books will include an introduction to the language; see IntroductoryBooks(https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntroductoryBooks) for suggested titles.Consult BeginnersGuide/Examples(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Examples) for small programs and little snippets of code that can help you learn.Or, if you prefer to learn Python through listening to a lecture, you can attend a training course or even hire a trainer to come to your company. Consult the PythonEvents(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEvents) page to see if any training courses are scheduled in your area and the PythonTraining(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTraining) page for a list of trainers.Teachers can join the EDUSIG(http://www.python.org/sigs/edusig/), a mailing list for discussion of Python's use in teaching at any level ranging from K12 up to university.

This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other adhoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X(https://www.python.org/downloads/macosx/), Windows(https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), Linux(https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), and Unix(https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), with unofficial builds also available for Android(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android) and iOS.Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and redistributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an opensource license(http://www.python.org/psf/license/).Some programminglanguage features of Python are:A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimitedlength long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.Python supports objectoriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.Code can be grouped into modules and packages.The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.See the SimplePrograms(https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms) collection of short programs, gradually increasing in length, which shows off Python's syntax and readability.Writing Pythonic code is not hardbut you have to get used to the (PEP) code style rules. You can test, check, and improve your code style at online resources such as Pythonchecker.com(http://pythonchecker.com/).Translations:\u4e2d\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd ChineseOverview(https://wiki.python.org/moin/TODO) BeginnersGuide/DownloadPython WikiSource: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) Downloading PythonOn many systems Python comes preinstalled, you can try running the `python` command to start the Python interpreter to check and see if it is already installed. On windows you can try the `py` command which is a launcher which is more likely to work. If it is installed you will see a response which will include the version number, for example:```Python 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64) on win32Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information.```If you don't see this, you will need to install Pyt"}
{"label": true, "text": "hon on your system.If the version number is Python 2.x.y (where `x` and `y` are any number) you are using Python 2 which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You can try running `python3` to see if there is also a Python 3.x.y version installed, if not you'll want to install the latest version of Python.If you do not have Python installed or need a newer version you can go to:https://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/)which will provide a button to download an installer for your particular system. The Python documentation also has a detailed guide on how to install and setup Python here:https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html(https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)Below are some system specific notes to keep in mind. WindowsOn Windows the most stable build is available from the official download pagehttps://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/)You should download and run the installer from that page to get the latest version of Python for your system. You can refer to the Python documentation for more details on the installation process and getting started:https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html(https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) MacFor macOS 10.9 (Jaguar) up until 12.3 (Catalina) the operating system includes Python 2, which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You should go to do the downloads page: https://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the installer.For newer versions of macOS, Python is no longer included by default and you will have to download and install it. You can refer to the Python documentation for more details on the installation process and getting started:https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html(https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html) LinuxOn most Linux distributions Python comes preinstalled and/or available via the distribution's package managers. Below are some common examples, but refer to your specific distribution's documentation and package list to get the most up to date instructions.If you'd like to download and build Python from source (or your distribution's package manager does not include a version of Python you need) you can download a source tarball from the general download page: https://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/) Red Hat, CentOS, or Fedora```dnf install python3 python3devel``` Debian or Ubuntu```aptget install python3 python3dev``` Gentoo```emerge devlang/python``` Arch Linux```pacman S python3``` IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironmentsPython WikiSource: https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments(https://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments)!(!)(https://wiki.python.org/wiki/europython/img/idea.png (!))

Python is a successor to the ABC programming language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and was for many years known by the humorous title Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL). Python evolution is now guided by an elected Steering Committee. Programming philosophyPython is a multiparadigm programming language. Rather than forcing programmers to adopt a particular style of programming, it permits several styles: objectoriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and there are a number of language features which support functional programming and aspectoriented programming (including metaprogramming and by magic methods). Many other paradigms are supported using extensions, such as pyDBC and Contracts for Python which allow Design by Contract.Rather than requiring all desired functionality to be built into the language's core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. New builtin modules can be easily written in C, C++ or Cython. Python can also be used as an extension language for existing modules and applications that need a programmable interface. This design, a small core language with a large standard library with an easily extensible interpreter, was intended by Van Rossum from the very start because of his frustrations with ABC (which espoused the opposite mindset). Name and neologismsAn important goal of the Python developers is making Python fun to use. This is reflected in the origin of the name (based on the television series Monty Python's Flying Circus), in the common practice of using Monty Python references in example code, and in an occasionally playful approach to tutorials and reference materials.2425 For example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, instead of the traditional foo and bar. UsagePython is often used as a scripting language for web applications, e.g. via modwsgi for the Apache web server. With Web Server Gateway Interface, a standard API has been developed to facilitate these applications. Web application frameworks like Django, Pylons, TurboGears(https://wiki.python.org/moin/TurboGears), web2py, Flask, and Zope support developers in the design and maintenance of complex applications. Libraries like NumPy(https://wiki.python.org/moin/NumPy), SciPy(https://wiki.python.org/moin/SciPy), and Matplotlib allow Python to be used effectively in scientific computing. Syntax and semanticsPython was intended to be a highly readable language. It is designed to have an uncluttered visual layout, frequently using Eng"}
{"label": true, "text": "lish keywords where other languages use punctuation. Python requires less boilerplate than traditional manifestly typed structured languages such as C or Pascal, and has a smaller number of syntactic exceptions and special cases than either of these. For a detailed description of the differences between 2.x and 3.x versions, see History of Python. IndentationPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly braces or keywords, to delimit blocks (a feature also known as the offside rule). An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block. Statements and control flowPython's statements include (among others):The if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of elseif).The for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.The while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.The try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that cleanup code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.The class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in objectoriented programming.The def statement, which defines a function or method.The with statement (from Python 2.5), which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run, and releasing the lock afterward).The pass statement, which serves as a NOP and can be used in place of a code block.The assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.The yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. (From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutinessee below.) ExpressionsIn Python 3, the result of the division operator `/` with integer operands is always a floatingpoint value; the operator `//` may be used to perform integer division (the result truncated to an integer).In Python 2, the `/` operator on integers performs integer division. Floatingpoint division on integers can be achieved by converting one of the integers to a float (e.g. `float(x)\u00a0/\u00a0y`), or, since 2.2, the behavior of Python 3 can be enabled using `from\u00a0future\u00a0import\u00a0division`.In Python, `==` compares by value, in contrast to Java, where it compares by reference. (Value comparisons in Java use the equals() method.) Python's `is` operator may be used to compare object identities (comparison by reference). Comparisons may be chained, for example `a\u00a0<=\u00a0b\u00a0<=\u00a0c`.Python uses the words and, or, not for its boolean operators rather than the symbolic `&&`, ``, `!` used in C.Python has a type of expression known as a list comprehension. Python 2.4 extended list comprehensions into a more general expression known as a generator expression.Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, these are limited in that the body can only be a single expression.Conditional expressions in Python are written as `x\u00a0if\u00a0c\u00a0else\u00a0y` (different in order of operands from the ?: operator common to many other languages).Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists, written as `1,\u00a02,\u00a03`, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as `(1,\u00a02,\u00a03)`, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided all elements of the tuple are immutable. The parentheses around the tuple are optional in some contexts. Tuples can appear on the left side of an equal sign; hence a statement like `x,\u00a0y\u00a0=\u00a0y,\u00a0x` can be used to swap two variables.Multiple str"}
{"label": true, "text": "ingformatting operations are supported. The original % operator provided behavior analogous to printf format strings in C, e.g. `foo=%s\u00a0bar=%d\u00a0%\u00a0(blah,\u00a02)` evaluates to `foo=blah\u00a0bar=2`. String templates were introduced in Python 2.4. Python 3.0 brought in the string `format()` method, with syntax like `foo={0}\u00a0bar={1}.format(blah,\u00a02)`. Formatted string literals (Fstrings) were introduced in 3.6, with syntax like `f'foo={blah}\u00a0bar={2}'`Python has various kinds of string literals:Strings are delimited by single or double quotation marks. Unlike in Unix shells, Perl and Perlinfluenced languages, single quotation marks and double quotation marks function identically. Both kinds of strings use the backslash (``) as an escape character and there is no implicit string interpolation such as $foo.Triplequoted strings, which begin and end with a series of three single or double quotation marks, may span multiple lines and function like heredocuments in shells, Perl and Ruby. MethodsMethods on objects are functions attached to the object's class; the syntax instance.method(argument) is, for normal methods and functions, syntactic sugar for Class.method(instance, argument). Python methods have an explicit self parameter to access instance data, in contrast to the implicit self in some other objectoriented programming languages (for example, Java, C++ or Ruby). TypingPython uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not welldefined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them. MathematicsPython defines the modulus operator so that the result of a % b is in the halfopen interval 0,b), where b is a positive integer. When b is negative, the result lies in the interval (b,0. However, this consequently affects how integer division is defined. To maintain the validity of the equation b(a // b) + a % b == a, integer division is defined to round towards minus infinity. Therefore 7 // 3 is 2, but (\u22127) // 3 is \u22123. This is different from many programming languages, where the result of integer division rounds towards zero, and Python's modulus operator is consequently defined in a way that can return negative numbers. Implementations CPythonThe mainstream Python implementation, known as CPython, is written in C meeting the C89 standard. CPython compiles Python programs into intermediate bytecode,65 which are then executed by the virtual machine. It is distributed with a large standard library written in a mixture of C and Python. CPython ships in versions for many platforms, including Microsoft Windows and most modern Unixlike systems. CPython was intended from almost its very conception to be crossplatform; its use and development on esoteric platforms such as Amoeba, alongside more conventional ones like Unix and Mac OS, has greatly helped in this regard. Unofficial builds are also available for Android(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android) and iOS. Alternative implementationsJython compiles the Python program into Java byte code, which can then be executed by every Java Virtual Machine implementation. This also enables the use of Java class library functions from the Python program. IronPython(https://wiki.python.org/moin/IronPython) follows a similar approach in order to run Python programs on the .NET Common Language Runtime. PyPy(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyPy) is a fast selfhosting implementation of Python, written in Python, that can output several types of bytecode, object code and intermediate languages. There also exist compilers to highlevel object languages, with either unrestricted Python, a restricted subset of Python, or a language similar to Python as the source language. PyPy(https://wiki.python.org/m"}
{"label": true, "text": "oin/PyPy) is of this type, compiling RPython to several languages; other examples include Pyjamas compiling to JavaScript(https://wiki.python.org/moin/JavaScript); Shed Skin compiling to C++; and Cython and Pyrex compiling to C. Interpretational semanticsMost Python implementations (including CPython) can function as a commandline interpreter, for which the user enters statements sequentially and receives the results immediately. In short, Python acts as a shell. While the semantics of the other modes of execution (bytecode compilation, or compilation to native code) preserve the sequential semantics, they offer a speed boost at the cost of interactivity, so they are usually only used outside of a commandline interaction (e.g., when importing a module).Other shells add capabilities beyond those in the basic interpreter, including IDLE and IPython. While generally following the visual style of the Python shell, they implement features like autocompletion, retention of session state, and syntax highlighting. DevelopmentPython's development is conducted largely through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process, described in PEP 1(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep0001/). PEPs are standardized design documents providing general information related to Python, including proposals, descriptions, design rationales, and explanations for language features. Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented upon on the pythondev mailing list, which is the primary forum for discussion about the language's development and approved by the Steering Council (see PEP 13(https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep013) for the governance model); specific issues are discussed in the bug tracker maintained at bugs.python.org(https://bugs.python.org/). Development of the reference implementation takes place on the GitHub cpython(https://github.com/python/cpython) repository.CPython's public releases come in three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:backwardincompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently\u2014for example, version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0.major or 'feature' releases, which are largely compatible but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. These releases are scheduled to occur roughly every 18 months, and each major version is supported by bugfixes for several years after its release.bugfix releases, which introduce no new features but fix bugs. The third and final part of the version number is incremented. These releases are made whenever a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release, or roughly every 3 months. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in bugfix releases.A number of alpha, beta, and releasecandidates are also released as previews and for testing before the final release is made. Although there is a rough schedule for each release, this is often pushed back if the code is not ready. The development team monitor the state of the code by running the large unit test suite during development, and using the BuildBot(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BuildBot) continuous integration system. Standard libraryPython has a large standard library, commonly cited as one of Python's greatest strengths,81 providing prewritten tools suited to many tasks. This is deliberate and has been described as a batteries included Python philosophy. The modules of the standard library can be augmented with custom modules written in either C or Python. Boost C++ Libraries includes a library, Boost.Python, to enable interoperability between C++ and Python. Because of the wide variety of tools provided by the standard library, combined with the ability to use a lowerlevel language such as C and C++, which is already capable of interfacing between other libraries, Python can be a powerful glue language between languages and tools.The standard library is pa"}
{"label": true, "text": "rticularly welltailored to writing Internetfacing applications, with a large number of standard formats and protocols (such as MIME and HTTP) already supported. Modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and doing unit testing are also included.Some parts of the standard library are covered by specifications (for example, the WSGI implementation wsgiref follows PEP 333), but the majority of the modules are not. They are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suite (if supplied). However, because most of the standard library is crossplatform Python code, there are only a few modules that must be altered or completely rewritten by alternative implementations.For software testing, the standard library provides the unittest and doctest modules. Influence on other languagesPython's design and philosophy have influenced several programming languages, including:Pyrex and its derivative Cython are code translators that are targeted at writing fast C extensions for the CPython interpreter. The language is mostly Python with syntax extensions for C and C++ features. Both languages produce compilable C code as output.Boo uses indentation, a similar syntax, and a similar object model. However, Boo uses static typing and is closely integrated with the .NET framework.84Cobra uses indentation and similar syntax. Cobra's Acknowledgements document lists Python first among the languages that influenced it. However, Cobra directly supports designbycontract, unit tests and optional static typing.borrowed iterators, generators, and list comprehensions from Python.Go is described as incorporating the development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python.Groovy was motivated by the desire to bring the Python design philosophy to Java.OCaml has an optional syntax, called twt (The Whitespace Thing), inspired by Python and Haskell.

If you are already familiar with running programs from the Windows command line then everything will seem obvious; otherwise, you might need a little more guidance.Unless you use some sort of integrated development environment, you will end up typing Windows commands into what is referred to as a \u201cCommand prompt window\u201d. Usually you can create such a window from your search bar by searching for `cmd`. You should be able to recognize when you have started such a window because you will see a Windows \u201ccommand prompt\u201d, which usually looks like this:The letter may be different, and there might be other things after it, so you might just as easily see something like:```D:YourNameProjectsPython>```depending on how your computer has been set up and what else you have recently done with it. Once you have started such a window, you are well on the way to running Python programs.You need to realize that your Python scripts have to be processed by another program called the Python interpreter. The interpreter reads your script, compiles it into bytecodes, and then executes the bytecodes to run your program. So, how do you arrange for the interpreter to handle your Python?First, you need to make sure that your command window recognises the word \u201cpy\u201d as an instruction to start the interpreter. If you have opened a command window, you should try entering the command `py` and hitting return:You should then see something like:```Python 3.6.4 (v3.6.4:d48eceb, Dec 19 2017, 06:04:45) MSC v.1900 32 bit (Intel) on win32Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information.>>>```You have started the interpreter in \u201cinteractive mode\u201d. That means you can enter Python statements or expressions interactively and have them executed or evaluated while you wait. This is one of Python\u2019s strongest features. Check it by entering a few expressions of your choice and seeing the results:```>>> print(Hello)Hello>>> Hello3'HelloHelloHello'```Many people use the interactive mode as a convenient yet highly programmable calculator. When you want to end your interactive Python session, call the `exit()`(http://www.python.org/doc/faq/library/constants.htmlexit exit) function or hold the `Ctrl` key down while you enter a `Z`, then hit the \u201c`Enter`\u201d key to get back to your Windows command prompt.You may also find that you have a Startmenu entry such as that results in you seeing the `>>>` prompt in a new window. If so, the window will disappear after you call the `exit()`(http://www.python.org/doc/faq/library/constants.htmlexit exit) functi"}
{"label": true, "text": "on or enter the `CtrlZ` character; Windows is running a single \u201cpython\u201d command in the window, and closes it when you terminate the interpreter.Now that we know the `py` command is recognized, you can give your Python script to it. You\u2019ll have to give either an absolute or a relative path to the Python script. Let\u2019s say your Python script is located in your desktop and is named `hello.py`, and your command prompt is nicely opened in your home directory so you\u2019re seeing something similar to:So now you\u2019ll ask the `py` command to give your script to Python by typing `py` followed by your script path:```C:UsersYourName> py Desktophello.pyhello``` How do I make Python scripts executable?(id3)\u00b6(howdoimakepythonscriptsexecutable Link to this heading)On Windows, the standard Python installer already associates the .py extension with a file type (Python.File) and gives that file type an open command that runs the interpreter (`D:Program FilesPythonpython.exe %1 %`). This is enough to make scripts executable from the command prompt as \u2018foo.py\u2019. If you\u2019d rather be able to execute the script by simple typing \u2018foo\u2019 with no extension you need to add .py to the PATHEXT environment variable. Why does Python sometimes take so long to start?(id4)\u00b6(whydoespythonsometimestakesolongtostart Link to this heading)Usually Python starts very quickly on Windows, but occasionally there are bug reports that Python suddenly begins to take a long time to start up. This is made even more puzzling because Python will work fine on other Windows systems which appear to be configured identically.The problem may be caused by a misconfiguration of virus checking software on the problem machine. Some virus scanners have been known to introduce startup overhead of two orders of magnitude when the scanner is configured to monitor all reads from the filesystem. Try checking the configuration of virus scanning software on your systems to ensure that they are indeed configured identically. McAfee, when configured to scan all file system read activity, is a particular offender. How do I make an executable from a Python script?(id5)\u00b6(howdoimakeanexecutablefromapythonscript Link to this heading)See How can I create a standalone binary from a Python script?(http://www.python.org/doc/faq/windows/programming.htmlfaqcreatestandalonebinary) for a list of tools that can be used to make executables. Is a `.pyd` file the same as a DLL?(id6)\u00b6(isapydfilethesameasadll Link to this heading)Yes, .pyd files are dll\u2019s, but there are a few differences. If you have a DLL named `foo.pyd`, then it must have a function `PyInitfoo()`. You can then write Python \u201cimport foo\u201d, and Python will search for foo.pyd (as well as foo.py, foo.pyc) and if it finds it, will attempt to call `PyInitfoo()` to initialize it. You do not link your .exe with foo.lib, as that would cause Windows to require the DLL to be present.Note that the search path for foo.pyd is PYTHONPATH, not the same as the path that Windows uses to search for foo.dll. Also, foo.pyd need not be present to run your program, whereas if you linked your program with a dll, the dll is required. Of course, foo.pyd is required if you want to say `import foo`. In a DLL, linkage is declared in the source code with `declspec(dllexport)`. In a .pyd, linkage is defined in a list of available functions. How can I embed Python into a Windows application?(id7)\u00b6(howcaniembedpythonintoawindowsapplication Link to this heading)Embedding the Python interpreter in a Windows app can be summarized as follows:1.Do not build Python into your .exe file directly. On Windows, Python must be a DLL to handle importing modules that are themselves DLL\u2019s. (This is the first key undocumented fact.) Instead, link to `pythonNN.dll`; it is typically installed in `C:WindowsSystem`. NN is the Python version, a number such as \u201c33\u201d for Python 3.3.You can link to Python in two different ways. Loadtime linking mean"}
{"label": true, "text": "s linking against `pythonNN.lib`, while runtime linking means linking against `pythonNN.dll`. (General note: `pythonNN.lib` is the socalled \u201cimport lib\u201d corresponding to `pythonNN.dll`. It merely defines symbols for the linker.)Runtime linking greatly simplifies link options; everything happens at run time. Your code must load `pythonNN.dll` using the Windows `LoadLibraryEx()` routine. The code must also use access routines and data in `pythonNN.dll` (that is, Python\u2019s C API\u2019s) using pointers obtained by the Windows `GetProcAddress()` routine. Macros can make using these pointers transparent to any C code that calls routines in Python\u2019s C API.2.If you use SWIG, it is easy to create a Python \u201cextension module\u201d that will make the app\u2019s data and methods available to Python. SWIG will handle just about all the grungy details for you. The result is C code that you link into your .exe file (!) You do not have to create a DLL file, and this also simplifies linking.3.SWIG will create an init function (a C function) whose name depends on the name of the extension module. For example, if the name of the module is leo, the init function will be called initleo(). If you use SWIG shadow classes, as you should, the init function will be called initleoc(). This initializes a mostly hidden helper class used by the shadow class.The reason you can link the C code in step 2 into your .exe file is that calling the initialization function is equivalent to importing the module into Python! (This is the second key undocumented fact.)4.In short, you can use the following code to initialize the Python interpreter with your extension module.```include <Python.h>...PyInitialize();// Initialize Python.initmyAppc();// Initialize (import) the helper class.PyRunSimpleString(import myApp);// Import the shadow class.```5.There are two problems with Python\u2019s C API which will become apparent if you use a compiler other than MSVC, the compiler used to build pythonNN.dll.Problem 1: The socalled \u201cVery High Level\u201d functions that take `FILE ` arguments will not work in a multicompiler environment because each compiler\u2019s notion of a `struct FILE` will be different. From an implementation standpoint these are very low level functions.Problem 2: SWIG generates the following code when generating wrappers to void functions:```PyINCREF(PyNone);resultobj = PyNone;return resultobj;```Alas, PyNone is a macro that expands to a reference to a complex data structure called PyNoneStruct inside pythonNN.dll. Again, this code will fail in a multcompiler environment. Replace such code by:```return PyBuildValue();```It may be possible to use SWIG\u2019s `%typemap` command to make the change automatically, though I have not been able to get this to work (I\u2019m a complete SWIG newbie).6.Using a Python shell script to put up a Python interpreter window from inside your Windows app is not a good idea; the resulting window will be independent of your app\u2019s windowing system. Rather, you (or the wxPythonWindow class) should create a \u201cnative\u201d interpreter window. It is easy to connect that window to the Python interpreter. You can redirect Python\u2019s i/o to any object that supports read and write, so all you need is a Python object (defined in your extension module) that contains read() and write() methods. How do I keep editors from inserting tabs into my Python source?(id8)\u00b6(howdoikeepeditorsfrominsertingtabsintomypythonsource Link to this heading)The FAQ does not recommend using tabs, and the Python style guide, PEP 8(https://peps.python.org/pep0008/), recommends 4 spaces for distributed Python code; this is also the Emacs pythonmode default.Under any editor, mixing tabs and spaces is a bad idea. MSVC is no different in this respect, and is easily configured to use spaces: Take , and for file type \u201cDefault\u201d set \u201cTab size\u201d and \u201cIndent size\u201d to 4, and select the \u201cInsert spaces\u201d radio bu"}

About the instructorSo what makes me eligible to teach you Python? Let me introduce myself!!(https://python.land/wpcontent/uploads/2023/05/Erikcolor300x300.png)I\u2019m Erik, and I\u2019ve worked as a software engineer for over 25 years. I hold an MSc in computer science and used many programming languages in my career, but Python is my absolute favorite! Although I love programming and building complex systems, I also love writing and teaching. Hence, I combined these two by writing tutorials and courses on this site.Eventually, I got fed up with the limited copyandpaste code examples and wanted example code that is editable and runnable inpage. It resulted in a side project (crumb.sh(https://crumb.sh/)) that offers a generic way to do this. The courses have many useful code crumbs sprinkled throughout them to improve the learning experience!

I use it to:Inform you about current Python trendsNew and existing articles you might likeAnd I\u2019ll include occasional course discount codes too. Python historyLet\u2019s start by defining more precisely what Python is. Python is a computer programming language.\u00a0Or, in other words, a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer to perform tasks. Its original creator, Guido van Rossum, named it after the BBC television show \u2018Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus.\u2019 Hence, you\u2019ll find that Python books, code examples, and documentation sometimes contain references to this television show.In 1987, Guido worked on a large distributed operating system at the CWI, a national research institute for mathematics and computer science in the Netherlands. Within that project, he had some freedom to work on side projects. With the knowledge and experience he had built up in the years before, working on a computer language called ABC, he started writing the Python programming language.Python is easy to learn, and it\u2019s designed around a set of clearly defined principles (the Zen of Python(https://python.land/thezenofpython)) that encourage Python core developers to make a language that is unambiguous and easy to use. ExtensibleIn a 2003 interview with Bill Venners(https://www.artima.com/articles/themakingofpython), Guido mentioned what was probably the biggest innovation in the new language:> I think my most innovative contribution to Python\u2019s success was making it easy to extend. That also came out of my frustration with ABC. ABC was a very monolithic design. There was a language design team, and they were God. They designed every language detail and there was no way to add to it. You could write your own programs, but you could"}
{"label": true, "text": "n\u2019t easily add lowlevel stuff.>> Guido van RossumHe decided you should be able to extend the language in two ways: by writing pure Python modules or by writing a module entirely in C. The former is obviously easier, but the latter allows for fast, highperformance modules like NumPy. It was a success because his CWI colleagues, the users, and Guido himself immediately started writing their own extension modules. The extension modules let you do all sorts of things. Just a small selection of modules that exist today:graphics libraries,data processing and data science(https://python.land/datascience) libraries like NumPy(https://python.land/datascience/numpy) and Pandas,AI and machine learning libraries,libraries to work with all sorts of file formats (like JSON(https://python.land/dataprocessing/workingwithjson), YAML(https://python.land/dataprocessing/pythonyaml)),all kinds of libraries to use and connect external services,build websites and website backends (e.g., Django, FastAPI)\u2026 and so onSince its inception, Guido has been actively involved in Python\u2019s development until this day. After a short retirement, he returned to work. Microsoft employs him, and his main focus is improving Python\u2019s speed. A timelineThe following figure shows a global timeline of Python\u2019s historical and most defining releases: Python 2 vs. Python 3As you can see from the Python history timeline, Python 2 and 3 have been developed and maintained side by side for an extended period. The primary reason is that Python 3 code is not entirely backward compatible with Python 2 code. This incompatibility caused a prolonged adoption rate. Many people were happy with version 2 and had no reason to upgrade.On top of that, Python 3 was initially slower than Python 2. As Python 3 kept improving and receiving new features, it eventually took off. With the latest efforts led by Guido, Python 3 is now faster than ever. In addition, Python 3 adds many useful features to the language, making it easier and more fun. Unless you need to maintain a legacy code base, avoid Python 2. Run Your First Python ProgramLet\u2019s dive in directly! We\u2019ll run the Python code from your browser to get started quickly. Later on, you\u2019ll learn all about installing Python on your computer.You can use the Python Playground to test and experiment with the examples in this Python tutorial. It allows you to enter Python code and run it by pressing the big green play button. The code runs in our backend on a real computer. Try it! Hello WorldThere\u2019s a tradition in which programming tutorials, books, and courses start with a socalled Hello World program. A Hello World program simply prints the words \u201cHello world\u201d to the screen. The Python playground above does precisely this, using the `print()` function.The `print()` function takes anything you put between the parentheses and prints it to the screen. But we must feed it the correct type of data for it to work. For example, we need to put text in Python between quotes. In the world of computer programming, we call this a string(https://python.land/introductiontopython/strings).Quotes around strings are essential because they precisely mark the start and end of a string. This way, a string is easy to recognize for Python. Here are a few more examples of valid strings:```'Hello world''My name is Eric''This one is a bit longer.'Code language: Python (python)```You can print these strings or a string of your choosing in the Python playground above, and I encourage you to do so! Like most things in life, programming requires practice to master it. Navigating the free Python tutorialI did everything I could to make browsing the free Python tutorial as easy as can be!

The Python TutorialSource: http://docs.python.org/tut/(http://docs.python.org/tut/)Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient highlevel data structures and a simple but effective approach to objectoriented programming. Python\u2019s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for"}
{"label": true, "text": " all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/(https://www.python.org/), and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for handson experience, but all examples are selfcontained, so the tutorial can be read offline as well.For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library(http://docs.python.org/library/index.htmllibraryindex). The Python Language Reference(http://docs.python.org/reference/index.htmlreferenceindex) gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter(http://docs.python.org/extending/index.htmlextendingindex) and Python/C API Reference Manual(http://docs.python.org/capi/index.htmlcapiindex). There are also several books covering Python in depth.This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python\u2019s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language\u2019s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library(http://docs.python.org/library/index.htmllibraryindex).The Glossary(http://docs.python.org/glossary.htmlglossary) is also worth going through.1.

It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.Python\u2019s standard library is very ex"}
{"label": true, "text": "tensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains builtin modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platformspecifics into platformneutral APIs.The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unixlike operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components.In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index(https://pypi.org/).Introduction(http://docs.python.org//lib/intro.html)Notes on availability(http://docs.python.org//lib/intro.htmlnotesonavailability)Builtin Functions(http://docs.python.org//lib/functions.html)Builtin Constants(http://docs.python.org//lib/constants.html)Constants added by the `site` module(http://docs.python.org//lib/constants.htmlconstantsaddedbythesitemodule)Builtin Types(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.html)Truth Value Testing(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmltruthvaluetesting)Boolean Operations \u2014 `and`, `or`, `not`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlbooleanoperationsandornot)Comparisons(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlcomparisons)Numeric Types \u2014 `int`, `float`, `complex`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlnumerictypesintfloatcomplex)Boolean Type`bool`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlbooleantypebool)Iterator Types(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmliteratortypes)Sequence Types \u2014 `list`, `tuple`, `range`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlsequencetypeslisttuplerange)Text Sequence Type \u2014 `str`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmltextsequencetypestr)Binary Sequence Types \u2014 `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlbinarysequencetypesbytesbytearraymemoryview)Set Types \u2014 `set`, `frozenset`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlsettypessetfrozenset)Mapping Types \u2014 `dict`(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlmappingtypesdict)Context Manager Types(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlcontextmanagertypes)Type Annotation Types \u2014 Generic Alias, Union(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmltypeannotationtypesgenericaliasunion)Other Builtin Types(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlotherbuiltintypes)Special Attributes(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlspecialattributes)Integer string conversion length limitation(http://docs.python.org//lib/stdtypes.htmlintegerstringconversionlengthlimitation)Builtin Exceptions(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.html)Exception context(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlexceptioncontext)Inheriting from builtin exceptions(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlinheritingfrombuiltinexceptions)Base classes(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlbaseclasses)Concrete exceptions(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlconcreteexceptions)Warnings(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlwarnings)Exception groups(http://docs.python.org//lib/exceptions.htmlexceptiongroups)Exceptio"}

{"label": true, "text": "other featuressearch within any window, replace within editor windows, and search through multiple files (grep)debugger with persistent breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of global and local namespacesconfiguration, browsers, and other dialogs Editing and Navigation\u00b6(editingandnavigation Link to this heading) Editor windows\u00b6(editorwindows Link to this heading)IDLE may open editor windows when it starts, depending on settings and how you start IDLE. Thereafter, use the File menu. There can be only one open editor window for a given file.The title bar contains the name of the file, the full path, and the version of Python and IDLE running the window. The status bar contains the line number (\u2018Ln\u2019) and column number (\u2018Col\u2019). Line numbers start with 1; column numbers with 0.IDLE assumes that files with a known .py extension contain Python code and that other files do not. Run Python code with the Run menu. Key bindings\u00b6(keybindings Link to this heading)The IDLE insertion cursor is a thin vertical bar between character positions. When characters are entered, the insertion cursor and everything to its right moves right one character and the new character is entered in the new space.Several noncharacter keys move the cursor and possibly delete characters. Deletion does not puts text on the clipboard, but IDLE has an undo list. Wherever this doc discusses keys, \u2018C\u2019 refers to the `Control` key on Windows and Unix and the `Command` key on macOS. (And all such dicussions assume that the keys have not been rebound to something else.)Arrow keys move the cursor one character or line.`CLeftArrow` and `CRightArrow` moves left or right one word.`Home` and `End` go to the beginning or end of the line.`Page Up` and `Page Down` go up or down one screen.`CHome` and `CEnd` go to beginning or end of the file.`Backspace` and `Del` (or `Cd`) delete the previous or next character.`CBackspace` and `CDel` delete one word left or right.`Ck` deletes (\u2018kills\u2019) everything to the right.Standard keybindings (like `Cc` to copy and `Cv` to paste) may work. Keybindings are selected in the Configure IDLE dialog. Automatic indentation\u00b6(automaticindentation Link to this heading)After a blockopening statement, the next line is indented by 4 spaces (in the Python Shell window by one tab). After certain keywords (break, return etc.) the next line is dedented. In leading indentation, `Backspace` deletes up to 4 spaces if they are there. `Tab` inserts spaces (in the Python Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent width. Currently, tabs are restricted to four spaces due to Tcl/Tk limitations.See also the indent/dedent region commands on the Format menu(formatmenu). Search and Replace\u00b6(searchandreplace Link to this heading)Any selection becomes a search target. However, only selections within a line work because searches are only performed within lines with the terminal newline removed. If `x Regular expression` is checked, the target is interpreted according to the Python re module. Completions\u00b6(completions Link to this heading)Completions are supplied, when requested and available, for module names, attributes of classes or functions, or filenames. Each request method displays a completion box with existing names. (See tab completions below for an exception.) For any box, change the name being completed and the item highlighted in the box by typing and deleting characters; by hitting `Up`, `Down`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`, and `End` keys; and by a single click within the box. Close the box with `Escape`, `Enter`, and double `Tab` keys or clicks outside the box. A double click within the box selects and closes.One way to open a box is to type a key character and wait for a predefined interval. This defaults to 2 seconds; customize it in the settings dialog. (To prevent auto popups, set the delay to a large number of milliseconds, such as 100000000.) For imported module names or class "}
{"label": true, "text": "or function attributes, type \u2018.\u2019. For filenames in the root directory, type `os.sep`(https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlos.sep os.sep) or `os.altsep`(https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.htmlos.altsep os.altsep) immediately after an opening quote. (On Windows, one can specify a drive first.) Move into subdirectories by typing a directory name and a separator.Instead of waiting, or after a box is closed, open a completion box immediately with Show Completions on the Edit menu. The default hot key is `Cspace`. If one types a prefix for the desired name before opening the box, the first match or near miss is made visible. The result is the same as if one enters a prefix after the box is displayed. Show Completions after a quote completes filenames in the current directory instead of a root directory.Hitting `Tab` after a prefix usually has the same effect as Show Completions. (With no prefix, it indents.) However, if there is only one match to the prefix, that match is immediately added to the editor text without opening a box.Invoking \u2018Show Completions\u2019, or hitting `Tab` after a prefix, outside of a string and without a preceding \u2018.\u2019 opens a box with keywords, builtin names, and available modulelevel names.When editing code in an editor (as oppose to Shell), increase the available modulelevel names by running your code and not restarting the Shell thereafter. This is especially useful after adding imports at the top of a file. This also increases possible attribute completions.Completion boxes initially exclude names beginning with \u2018\u2019 or, for modules, not included in \u2018all\u2019. The hidden names can be accessed by typing \u2018\u2019 after \u2018.\u2019, either before or after the box is opened. Calltips\u00b6(calltips Link to this heading)A calltip is shown automatically when one types `(` after the name of an accessible function. A function name expression may include dots and subscripts. A calltip remains until it is clicked, the cursor is moved out of the argument area, or `)` is typed. Whenever the cursor is in the argument part of a definition, select Edit and \u201cShow Call Tip\u201d on the menu or enter its shortcut to display a calltip.The calltip consists of the function\u2019s signature and docstring up to the latter\u2019s first blank line or the fifth nonblank line. (Some builtin functions lack an accessible signature.) A \u2018/\u2019 or \u2018\u2019 in the signature indicates that the preceding or following arguments are passed by position or name (keyword) only. Details are subject to change.In Shell, the accessible functions depends on what modules have been imported into the user process, including those imported by Idle itself, and which definitions have been run, all since the last restart.For example, restart the Shell and enter `itertools.count(`. A calltip appears because Idle imports itertools into the user process for its own use. (This could change.) Enter `turtle.write(` and nothing appears. Idle does not itself import turtle. The menu entry and shortcut also do nothing. Enter `import turtle`. Thereafter, `turtle.write(` will display a calltip.In an editor, import statements have no effect until one runs the file. One might want to run a file after writing import statements, after adding function definitions, or after opening an existing file. Code Context\u00b6(codecontext Link to this heading)Within an editor window containing Python code, code context can be toggled in order to show or hide a pane at the top of the window. When shown, this pane freezes the opening lines for block code, such as those beginning with `class`, `def`, or `if` keywords, that would have otherwise scrolled out of view. The size of the pane will be expanded and contracted as needed to show the all current levels of context, up to the maximum number of lines defined in the Configure IDLE dialog (which defaults to 15). If there are no current context lines and the feature is toggled on, a single blank line will display. Clicking on a line in the context pane will move that line to the top of the editor.The text an"}
{"label": true, "text": "d background colors for the context pane can be configured under the Highlights tab in the Configure IDLE dialog. Shell window\u00b6(shellwindow Link to this heading)In IDLE\u2019s Shell, enter, edit, and recall complete statements. (Most consoles and terminals only work with a single physical line at a time).Submit a singleline statement for execution by hitting `Return` with the cursor anywhere on the line. If a line is extended with Backslash (``), the cursor must be on the last physical line. Submit a multiline compound statement by entering a blank line after the statement.When one pastes code into Shell, it is not compiled and possibly executed until one hits `Return`, as specified above. One may edit pasted code first. If one pastes more than one statement into Shell, the result will be a `SyntaxError`(https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.htmlSyntaxError SyntaxError) when multiple statements are compiled as if they were one.Lines containing `RESTART` mean that the user execution process has been restarted. This occurs when the user execution process has crashed, when one requests a restart on the Shell menu, or when one runs code in an editor window.The editing features described in previous subsections work when entering code interactively. IDLE\u2019s Shell window also responds to the following:`Cc` attempts to interrupt statement execution (but may fail).`Cd` closes Shell if typed at a `>>>` prompt.`Altp` and `Altn` (`Cp` and `Cn` on macOS) retrieve to the current prompt the previous or next previously entered statement that matches anything already typed.`Return` while the cursor is on any previous statement appends the latter to anything already typed at the prompt. Text colors\u00b6(textcolors Link to this heading)Idle defaults to black on white text, but colors text with special meanings. For the shell, these are shell output, shell error, user output, and user error. For Python code, at the shell prompt or in an editor, these are keywords, builtin class and function names, names following `class` and `def`, strings, and comments. For any text window, these are the cursor (when present), found text (when possible), and selected text.IDLE also highlights the soft keywords(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexicalanalysis.htmlsoftkeywords) `match`(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compoundstmts.htmlmatch), `case`(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compoundstmts.htmlmatch), and ``(https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compoundstmts.htmlwildcardpatterns) in patternmatching statements. However, this highlighting is not perfect and will be incorrect in some rare cases, including some ``s in `case` patterns.Text coloring is done in the background, so uncolorized text is occasionally visible. To change the color scheme, use the Configure IDLE dialog Highlighting tab. The marking of debugger breakpoint lines in the editor and text in popups and dialogs is not userconfigurable. Startup and Code Execution\u00b6(startupandcodeexecution Link to this heading)Upon startup with the `s` option, IDLE will execute the file referenced by the environment variables `IDLESTARTUP` or `PYTHONSTARTUP`(https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.htmlenvvarPYTHONSTARTUP). IDLE first checks for `IDLESTARTUP`; if `IDLESTARTUP` is present the file referenced is run. If `IDLESTARTUP` is not present, IDLE checks for `PYTHONSTARTUP`. Files referenced by these environment variables are convenient places to store functions that are used frequently from the IDLE shell, or for executing import statements to import common modules.In addition, `Tk` also loads a startup file if it is present. Note that the Tk file is loaded unconditionally. This additional file is `.Idle.py` and is looked for in the user\u2019s home directory. Statements in this file will be executed in the Tk namespace, so this file is not useful for importing functions to be used from IDLE\u2019s Python shell.

No editor window is opened, even if that is the default set in the Options dialog.Otherwise, arguments are files opened for editing and `sys.argv` reflects the arguments passed to IDLE itself. Startup failure\u00b6(startupfailure Link to this heading)IDLE uses a socket to communicate between the IDLE GUI process and the user code execution process. A connection must be established whenever the Shell starts or restarts. (The latter is indicated by a divider line that says \u2018RESTART\u2019). If the user process fails to connect to the GUI process, it usually displays a `Tk` error box with a \u2018cannot connect\u2019 message that directs the user here. It then exits.One specific connection failure on Unix systems results from misconfigured masquerading rules somewhere in a system\u2019s network setup. When IDLE is started from a terminal, one will see a message starting with ` Invalid host:`. The valid value is `127.0.0.1 (idlelib.rpc.LOCALHOST)`. One can diagnose with `tcpconnect irv 127.0.0.1 6543` in one terminal window and `tcplisten <same args>` in another.A common cause of failure is a userwritten file with the same name as a standard library module, such as random.py and tkinter.py. When such a file is located in the same directory as a file that is about to be run, IDLE cannot import the stdlib file. The current fix is to rename the user file.Though less common than in the past, an antivirus or firewall program may stop the connection. If the program cannot be taught to allow the connection, then it must be turned off for IDLE to work. It is safe to allow this internal connection because no data is visible on external ports. A similar problem is a network misconfiguration that blocks connections.Python installation issues occasionally stop IDLE: multiple versions can clash, or a single installation might need admin access. If one undo the clash, or cannot or does not want to run as admin, it might be easiest to completely remove Python and start over.A zombie pythonw.exe process could be a problem. On Windows, use Task Manager to check for one and stop it if there is. Sometimes a restart initiated by a program crash or Keyboard Interrupt (controlC) may fail to connect. Dismissing the error box or using Restart Shell on the Shell menu may fix a temporary problem.When IDLE first starts, it attempts to read user configuration files in `~/.idlerc/` (~ is one\u2019s home directory). If there is a problem, an error message should be displayed. Leaving aside random disk glitches, this can be prevented by never editing the files by hand. Instead, use the configuration dialog, under Options. Once there is an error in a user configuration file, the best solution may be to delete it and start over with the settings dialog.If IDLE quits with no message, and it was not started from a console, try starting it from a console or terminal (`python m idlelib`) and see if this results in an error message.On Unixbased systems with tcl/tk older than `8.6.11` (see `About IDLE`) certain characters of certain fonts can cause a tk failure with a message to the terminal. This can happen either if one starts IDLE to edit a file with such a character or later when entering such a character. If one cannot upgrade tcl/tk, then reconfigure IDLE to use a font that works better. Running user code\u00b6(runningusercode Link to this heading)With rare exceptions,"}
{"label": true, "text": " the result of executing Python code with IDLE is intended to be the same as executing the same code by the default method, directly with Python in a textmode system console or terminal window. However, the different interface and operation occasionally affect visible results. For instance, `sys.modules` starts with more entries, and `threading.activecount()` returns 2 instead of 1.By default, IDLE runs user code in a separate OS process rather than in the user interface process that runs the shell and editor. In the execution process, it replaces `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr` with objects that get input from and send output to the Shell window. The original values stored in `sys.stdin`, `sys.stdout`, and `sys.stderr` are not touched, but may be `None`.Sending print output from one process to a text widget in another is slower than printing to a system terminal in the same process. This has the most effect when printing multiple arguments, as the string for each argument, each separator, the newline are sent separately. For development, this is usually not a problem, but if one wants to print faster in IDLE, format and join together everything one wants displayed together and then print a single string. Both format strings and `str.join()`(https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.htmlstr.join str.join) can help combine fields and lines.IDLE\u2019s standard stream replacements are not inherited by subprocesses created in the execution process, whether directly by user code or by modules such as multiprocessing. If such subprocess use `input` from sys.stdin or `print` or `write` to sys.stdout or sys.stderr, IDLE should be started in a command line window. (On Windows, use `python` or `py` rather than `pythonw` or `pyw`.) The secondary subprocess will then be attached to that window for input and output.If `sys` is reset by user code, such as with `importlib.reload(sys)`, IDLE\u2019s changes are lost and input from the keyboard and output to the screen will not work correctly.When Shell has the focus, it controls the keyboard and screen. This is normally transparent, but functions that directly access the keyboard and screen will not work. These include systemspecific functions that determine whether a key has been pressed and if so, which.The IDLE code running in the execution process adds frames to the call stack that would not be there otherwise. IDLE wraps `sys.getrecursionlimit` and `sys.setrecursionlimit` to reduce the effect of the additional stack frames.When user code raises SystemExit either directly or by calling sys.exit, IDLE returns to a Shell prompt instead of exiting. User output in Shell\u00b6(useroutputinshell Link to this heading)When a program outputs text, the result is determined by the corresponding output device. When IDLE executes user code, `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are connected to the display area of IDLE\u2019s Shell. Some of its features are inherited from the underlying Tk Text widget. Others are programmed additions. Where it matters, Shell is designed for development rather than production runs.For instance, Shell never throws away output. A program that sends unlimited output to Shell will eventually fill memory, resulting in a memory error. In contrast, some system text windows only keep the last n lines of output. A Windows console, for instance, keeps a usersettable 1 to 9999 lines, with 300 the default.A Tk Text widget, and hence IDLE\u2019s Shell, displays characters (codepoints) in the BMP (Basic Multilingual Plane) subset of Unicode. Which characters are displayed with a proper glyph and which with a replacement box depends on the operating system and installed fonts. Tab characters cause the following text to begin after the next tab stop. (They occur every 8 \u2018characters\u2019). Newline characters cause following text to appear on a new line. Other control characters are ignored or displayed as a space, box, or something else, depending on the operating system and font. (Moving the text cursor through such output with arrow keys may exhibi"}

Result varies by OS and font.Try it.```The `repr` function is used for interactive echo of expression values. It returns an altered version of the input string in which control codes, some BMP codepoints, and all nonBMP codepoints are replaced with escape codes. As demonstrated above, it allows one to identify the characters in a string, regardless of how they are displayed.Normal and error output are generally kept separate (on separate lines) from code input and each other. They each get different highlight colors.For SyntaxError tracebacks, the normal \u2018^\u2019 marking where the error was detected is replaced by coloring the text with an error highlight. When code run from a file causes other exceptions, one may right click on a traceback line to jump to the corresponding line in an IDLE editor. The file will be opened if necessary.Shell has a special facility for squeezing output lines down to a \u2018Squeezed text\u2019 label. This is done automatically for output over N lines (N = 50 by default). N can be changed in the PyShell section of the General page of the Settings dialog. Output with fewer lines can be squeezed by right clicking on the output. This can be useful lines long enough to slow down scrolling.Squeezed output is expanded in place by doubleclicking the label. It can also be sent to the clipboard or a separate view window by rightclicking the label. Developing tkinter applications\u00b6(developingtkinterapplications Link to this heading)IDLE is intentionally different from standard Python in order to facilitate development of tkinter programs. Enter `import tkinter as tk; root = tk.Tk()` in standard Python and nothing appears. Enter the same in IDLE and a tk window appears. In standard Python, one must also enter `root.update()` to see the window. IDLE does the equivalent in the background, about 20 times a second, which is about every 50 milliseconds. Next enter `b = tk.Button(root, text='button'); b.pack()`. Again, nothing visibly changes in standard Python until one enters `root.update()`.Most tkinter programs run `root.mainloop()`, which usually does not return until the tk app is destroyed. If the program is run with `python i` or from an IDLE editor, a `>>>` shell prompt does not appear until `mainloop()` returns, at which time there is nothing left to interact with.When running a tkinter program from an IDLE editor, one can comment out the mainloop call. One then gets a shell prompt immediately and can interact with the live application. One just has to remember to reenable the mainloop call when running in standard Python. Running without a subprocess\u00b6(runningwithoutasubprocess Link to this heading)By default, IDLE executes user code in a separate subprocess via a socket, which uses the internal loopback interface. This connection is not externally visible and no data is sent to or received from the internet. If firewall software complains anyway, you can ignore it.If the attempt to make the socket connection fails, Idle will notify you. Such failures are sometimes transient, but if persistent, the problem may be either a firewall blocking the connection or misconfiguration of a particular system. Until the problem is fixed, one can run Idle with the n command line switch.If IDLE is started with the n command line switch it will run in a single process and will not create the subprocess which runs the RPC Python execution server. This can be useful if Python cannot create the subprocess or the RPC socket interface on your platform. However, in this mode user code is not isolated from IDLE itself. Also, the environment is not restarted when Run/Run Module (F5) is selected. If your code has been modified, you must reload() the affected modules and reimport any specific items (e.g. from foo import baz) if the changes are to take effect. For these reasons, it "}

Setting preferences\u00b6(settingpreferences Link to this heading)The font preferences, highlighting, keys, and general preferences can be changed via Configure IDLE on the Option menu. Nondefault user settings are saved in a `.idlerc` directory in the user\u2019s home directory. Problems caused by bad user configuration files are solved by editing or deleting one or more of the files in `.idlerc`.On the Font tab, see the text sample for the effect of font face and size on multiple characters in multiple languages. Edit the sample to add other characters of personal interest. Use the sample to select monospaced fonts. If particular characters have problems in Shell or an editor, add them to the top of the sample and try changing first size and then font.On the Highlights and Keys tab, select a builtin or custom color theme and key set. To use a newer builtin color theme or key set with older IDLEs, save it as a new custom theme or key set and it well be accessible to older IDLEs.

The answer is profound: if you cannot read and write oneliner code snippets, how can you ever hope to read and write more complicated codebases? Python oneliners can be just as powerful as a long and tedious program written in another language designed to do the same thing.

However, if you use wellestablished oneliner tricks such as list comprehension(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.htmllistcomprehensions) or the ternary operator(https://blog.finxter.com/pythononelineternary/), they tend to be Pythonic.So, use your oneliner superpower wisely!

It's pretty similar to the c way of executing python, but it imports common modules and has its own preset variable that help with splitting/joining, line counter, etc. You use pipes to pass information forward instead of nested parentheses, and then use your normal python string and list methods. Here is an example from the homepage:Here, we take a Linux long listing, capture every other of the 5th through the 10th lines, keep the username and filename fields, replace hello with goodbye, capitalize the first letter of every word, and then add the text is splendid to the end:```ls lpyp pp5:11:2whitespace2, w1p.replace('hello','goodbye')p.title(),'is splendid'```and the explanation:This uses pyp's builtin string and list variables (p and pp), as well as the variable whitespace and its shortcut w, which both represent a list based on splitting each line on whitespace (whitespace = w = p.split()). The other functions and selection techniques are all standard Python.

Don\u2019t let anyone tell you different. If you bought or are considering buying this book because someone told you that you should learn Python, then maybe you should reconsider. The big question to ask yourself is \u201cDo you want to learn Python?\u201d Certainly, this book will help you answer that question, but be prepared to struggle, and to make mistakes, and to get frustrated, and to bang your head against the keyboard. This is Pandora\u2019s box, baby, but\u2026If you get excited by solving hard problems\u2026 if you\u2019re into Sudoku, or crosswords, or jigsaw puzzles, or if you\u2019ll spend hours trying to figure out how to separate two metal looping thingamajigs that you found on someone\u2019s shelf\u2026, or you like tinkering with engines, or figuring out the best recipe for chocolate chip cookies\u2026 in other words, if you like a challenge, then you might love Python programming.It\u2019s not easy, but it\u2019s easy enough to get started. Pick up a book (good start!), and start going through it. Be patient with yourself. Pretend you\u2019re the teacher as well as the student. When the student fails, the good teacher doesn\u2019t insult or chastise. The good teacher encourages. The good teacher knows that failure is a part of learning, and that overcoming failure is exciting and leads to more learning. So, be a good teacher and treat yourself well.But be a good student too. When reading this book, you should be sitting at your computer. When you first begin, plan to spend at least two uninterrupted hours. You should do your best to get through the first two lessons in the first sitting. That will get you through the foundational learning. From there on out, you\u2019ll be hopping back and forth between the book and viewing, editing, and writing code. Go through the book slowly and methodically. Read every demo carefully. Work through every exercise. You cannot learn to code through reading alone. You must practice.This book assume no prior knowledge of Python, but it introduces some pretty advanced topics, such as working with databases, scraping the web, and objectoriented Python.Learning IoT Page(https://www.learningiot.net/)Learning IoT with Python and Raspberry Pi(https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/learningiotwithpythonandraspberrypieihorvath/1133345171?ean=9780578549361)E.I.

Knowing more about how Python works under the covers, including the relationship between data objects and memory management, will make you a much more effective Python programmer coming out of the gate. The advanced topics chapters are meant as complete intros or quick dives into each of those distinct subjects. However, if moving towards those specific areas of development, they are more than enough to get you pointed in the right direction. We would say that the book is 40% introductory, 40% intermediate (indepth core Python material plus advanced topics chapters), and 20% referenceit is ot meant to be a substitute for a pure reference such as the Python Essential Reference or Python in a Nutshell.The new 2nd edition is expanded (300 new pages!) and updated through Python 2.5 as well as confirmed functionality for future versions! Also added are a few new chapters of advanced material. As in the 1st edition, a plethora of easy to advanced exercises can be found at the end of every chapter to hammer the concepts home. At the moment, this is the most complete and uptodate Python book on the market today.From an anonymous reviewer: Very well written. It is the clearest, friendliest book I have come across yet for explaining Python, and putting it in a wider context. It does not presume a large amount of other experience. It may be too slow for more advanced people, but it does go into some important Python topics carefully and in depth. Unlike too many beginner books, it never condescends or tortures the reader with childish hideandseek prose games. Not too many indepth realworld examples in the book (hopefully he will do a followup volume), it sticks to gaining a solid grasp of Python syntax and structure.Home Page(http://corepython.com/) (includes book reviews, errata, sample chapter, links to alternate editions, source code from the book, and more!)Links regarding the 1st edition: IBM Developer Works review(http://www106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/lpbook3.html) Linux Journal review(http://www2.linuxjournal.com/ljissues/issue85/4564.html) Chinese edition(http://www.chinapub.com/computers/common"}

While skill credentials and a portfolio of past training gigs are important, perhaps one of the best promoters is when someone has actually experienced one of your classes. They gain insight into your speaking style, how you relate to the students and your ability to explain complex technical subjects in an approachable way. No class syllabus can convey that. The Python community has a valuable resource that can give you the next best thing.Marilyn Davis, Ph.D., of PythonTrainer(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonTrainer).com, offers a free course: Python For Programmers Check it out:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7J0e0ovYAI(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7J0e0ovYAI)Screencasting is a multimedia creation that focuses on the instructor's desktop, with voiceover guidance. It can be in the format of an online slideshow, a guided sourcecode walkthrough or a followalong interactive session. They can be as long or short as you wish and they have opportunities for branding, by using custom wallpaper behind your talks desktop and musical leadin/fadeout.Screencasts can be hosted on video.google.com(http://video.google.com/). They can also be embedded in your website while hosted elsewhere, as shown in our 5Minutes with Python(http://www.python.org/doc/av/5minutes/) series.But perhaps you're really busy on current projects and short on time. Consider doing an audio interview about an upcoming seminar you're offering and releasing it as a podcast. Ron Stephens of Python 411 makes available an excellent collection of podcasts and may be interested in hosting yours.Unlike facetoface presentation opportunities, screencasts/podcasts have the additional benefit that they promote your training offerings while you're busy on other gigs. It's almost like cloning yourself and having more time for promotion. It's all about leverage. Use it. Public training courses presented by these trainers are listed on the PythonEvents(https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEvents) page.Before creation of this page, CameronLaird(https://wiki.python.org/moin/CameronLaird) maintained a private one(http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.lang.python/pythontraining.html) on the same subject.CategoryPythonInBusiness(https://wiki.python.org/moin/CategoryPythonInBusiness) BeginnersG"}

On windows you can try the `py` command which is a launcher which is more likely to work. If it is installed you will see a response which will include the version number, for example:```Python 3.9.6 (tags/v3.9.6:db3ff76, Jun 28 2021, 15:26:21) MSC v.1929 64 bit (AMD64) on win32Type help, copyright, credits or license for more information.```If you don't see this, you will need to install Python on your system.If the version number is Python 2.x.y (where `x` and `y` are any number) you are using Python 2 which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You can try running `python3` to see if there is also a Python 3.x.y version installed, if not you'll want to install the latest version of Python.If you do not have Python installed or need a newer version you can go to:https://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/)which will provide a button to download an installer for your particular system. The Python documentation also has a detailed guide on how to install and setup Python here:https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html(https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html)Below are some system specific notes to keep in mind. WindowsOn Windows the most stable build is available from the official download pagehttps://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/)You should download and run the installer from that page to get the latest version of Python for your system. You can refer to the Python documentation for more details on the installation process and getting started:https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html(https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html) MacFor macOS 10.9 (Jaguar) up until 12.3 (Catalina) the operating system includes Python 2, which is no longer supported and is not a good choice for development. You should go to do the downloads page: https://www.python.org/downloads/(https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the installer.For newer versions of macOS, Python is no longer included by default and you will have to download and install it.

This makes Python ideal for prototype development and other adhoc programming tasks, without compromising maintainability.Comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as connecting to web servers, searching text with regular expressions, reading and modifying files.Python's interactive mode makes it easy to test short snippets of code. There's also a bundled development environment called IDLE.Is easily extended by adding new modules implemented in a compiled language such as C or C++.Can also be embedded into an application to provide a programmable interface.Runs anywhere, including Mac OS X(https://www.python.org/downloads/macosx/), Windows(https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), Linux(https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), and Unix(https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html), with unofficial builds also available for Android(https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android) and iOS.Is free software in two senses. It doesn't cost anything to download or use Python, or to include it in your application. Python can also be freely modified and redistributed because while the language is copyrighted it's available under an opensource license(http://www.python.org/psf/license/).Some programminglanguage features of Python are:A variety of basic data types are available: numbers (floating point, complex, and unlimitedlength long integers), strings (both ASCII and Unicode), lists, and dictionaries.Python supports objectoriented programming with classes and multiple inheritances.Code can be grouped into modules and packages.The language supports raising and catching exceptions, resulting in cleaner error handling.Data types are strongly and dynamically typed. Mixing incompatible types (e.g. attempting to add a string and a number) causes an exception to be raised, so errors are caught sooner.Python contains advanced programming features such as generators and list comprehensions.Python's automatic memory management frees you from having to manually allocate and free memory in your code.See the SimplePrograms(https://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms) collection of short programs, gradually increasing in length, which shows off Python's syntax and readability.Writing Pythonic code is not hardbut you have to get used to the (PEP) code style rules. You can test, check, and improve your code style at online resources such as Pythonchecker.com(http://pythonchecker.com/).Translations:\u4e2d\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd ChineseOverview(https://wiki.python.org/moin/TODO) BeginnersGuide/OverviewChinesePython WikiSource: https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/OverviewChinese(https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/OverviewChinese)Python\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u6d01\u4f46\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u5b83\u7c7b\u4f3cPerl\uff0cRuby\uff0cScheme\u6216Java\u3002Python\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff1a\u4f18\u96c5\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f16\u5199\u548c\u9605\u8bfb\u90fd\u5f88\u7b80\u5355\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u597d\u7528\uff0c\u8f7b\u677e\u5199\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7279\u70b9\u8ba9Python\u505a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f88\u65b9\u4fbf\uff1a\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u578b\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5c0f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u7528\u592a\u8d39\u52b2\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002\u5185\u7f6e\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5e93\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u8fde\u63a5\u7f51\u9875\u670d\u52a1\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8bfb\u5199\u6587\u4ef6\u3002Python\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8f7b\u677e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528IDLE\u7684\u96c6\u6210"}

All links open in a new tab (so feel free to click all links without worrying about losing this page).Here\u2019s a quick summary if you don\u2019t have time reading all cheat sheets:The visually most appealing NumPy cheat sheet (incl. cheat sheet video)(https://blog.finxter.com/numpycheatsheet/)The most comprehensive NumPy cheat sheet(http://hyperpolyglot.org/numericalanalysis)The most general data science cheat sheet(https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blogassets/NumpyPythonCheatSheet.pdf)Here\u2019s a quick download for you: I created this cheating sheet to explain some important NumPy concepts to\u00a0my coding students(https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/).NumPy(https://docs.scipy.org/) is a widely used Python scientific computing package. It simplifies linear algebra, matrix computations, and speeds up data analysis. Knowing NumPy is a prerequisite for other Python packages like pandas or ScikitLearn.This article should serve as the ultimate NumPy reference. The cheat sheets are diverse and range from one page to multiple pages. They also involve crosslanguage comparison cheat sheets. While some resources are great beginner\u2019s references, others are involved and require highlevel expertise. Cheat Sheet 1: DataCamp NumPy(https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blogassets/NumpyPythonCheatSheet.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik11024x725.png)(https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blogassets/NumpyPythonCheatSheet.pdf)DataCamp is an online platform that offers data science training through videos and coding exercises(https://finxter.com/). This cheat sheet is one of the most comprehensive onepage cheat sheets available. In a way, it adds to the previous cheat sheet with more examples and more functions. It is a good summary of creating arrays and basic array design. This cheat sheet provides functions for the specific datatypes. At the end of the sheet is more advanced stuff like slicing(https://blog.finxter.com/introductiontoslicinginpython/) and indexing. There are also some introductory tools for data analysis and array manipulation. Though overall, this is a fantastic resource, the one drawback is the color palette. The bright orange is a distraction from the content. If you like the color palette, this could be your comprehensive goto list of the NumPy basics(https://blog.finxter.com/numpytutorial/).Pros: Comprehensive, graphics, very denseCons: Overwhelming, color may distract Cheat Sheet 2: Basic NumPy(https://cdn.intellipaat.com/mediaFiles/2018/12/PythonNumPyCheatSheet.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik1024x575.png)(https://cdn.intellipaat.com/mediaFiles/2018/12/PythonNumPyCheatSheet.pdf)This is a useful resource for the NumPy basics. It provides a summary of creating arrays and some basic operations. It is minimalistic, with a good overview of many basic functions. The sheet is divided into sections with headers for easier orientation. On the lefthand side of the sheet, the NumPy import convention is mentioned `import numpy as np`. A oneline explanation(https://blog.finxter.com/pythononelinerssamplinga2dpythonlisttospeedupmachinelearning/) follows each function. The biggest advantage of this list is good readability. This enables a quick search for the right function.Pros: Lightweight, basics, minimalistic, readableCons: Shallow, distracting background image, no visuals Cheat Sheet 3: A Little Bit of Everything(http://datasciencefree.com/numpy.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik21024x790.png)(http://datasciencefree.com/numpy.pdf)The cheat sheet is divided into four parts. The first part goes into details about NumPy arrays(https://blog"}
{"label": true, "text": ".finxter.com/howtoconvertlistofliststonumpyarray/), and some useful functions like `np.arange()` or finding the number of dimensions. The 2nd part focuses on slicing and indexing, and it provides some delightful examples of Boolean indexing(https://blog.finxter.com/howtousenumpybooleanindexingtouncoverinstagraminfluencers/). The last two columns are a little bit disconnected. They provide a wide range of functions, ranging from matrix operations like transpose to sorting an array(https://blog.finxter.com/pythonlistsort/). However, the last two columns are not necessarily grouped conveniently. The advantage of this sheet is that it also includes Boolean and not only the numerical types(https://blog.finxter.com/decimalpythonsfloattrapandhowtosolveit/).Pros: Focus on slicing and dimensionalityCons: Disconnected content, slightly confusing, no graphics Cheat Sheet 4: Data Science(https://s3.amazonaws.com/dqblogfiles/numpycheatsheet.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik31024x695.png)(https://s3.amazonaws.com/dqblogfiles/numpycheatsheet.pdf)Dataquest is a similar online platform to DataCamp. It offers a variety of data science(https://blog.finxter.com/coffeebreaknumpy/) tracks and lessons, followed by coding exercises. This is another good resource of the most important NumPy functions and properties. The cheat sheet is readable with distinct sections, and each section has a clear title. Besides the sheet organization and excellent readability, it provides a range of functions and operations. Also, compared to the previous two cheat sheets, there is a math (https://blog.finxter.com/pythonmathmodule/)and statistics section. It divides the math sections into scalar and vector math, and there is a statistics section at the bottom.Pros: Statistics, HTMLbased, wellstructured, comprehensive, readableCons: No graphics Cheat Sheet 5: NumPy for Matlab Users(http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlabnumpy.html)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik4.png)(http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlabnumpy.html)If you are a Matlab user and need a quick introduction to Python (https://blog.finxter.com/pythoncrashcourse/)and NumPy, this could be your goto. The sheet contains three columns \u2013 the first column is the Matlab/Octave, the second column are the Python and NumPy equivalents, and the third is a description column. The sheet\u2019s focus is not solely on NumPy, but there are many Python basics listed. Since it is not a single sheet, the content is organized into separate sections. It provides math(https://blog.finxter.com/pythonmathmodule/), logical and boolean operators, roots and round offs, complex numbers, extensive linear algebra, reshaping (https://blog.finxter.com/numpyreshape/)and indexing(https://blog.finxter.com/howtousenumpybooleanindexingtouncoverinstagraminfluencers/), some basic plots(https://blog.finxter.com/matplotliblineplot/), calculus, and statistics(https://blog.finxter.com/numpyaveragealongaxis/).Pros: Matlab, Python background, a wide spectrum of related contentCons: Unfocused, not visually too appealing, font choice strange Cheat Sheet 6: The Matrix(https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2014/matrixcheatsheettable.html)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik51024x379.png)(https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2014/matrixcheatsheettable.html)This cheat sheet provides the equivalents for four different languages \u2013 MATLAB/Octave, Python and NumPy, R, and Julia. The list is not a single PDF sheet, but it is a scrollable document. On each far lefthand and the righthand side of the document, there are task descriptions. This is an extensive sheet, and it is extra useful because the output of each task is given. The sheet covers creating and designing of matrices, matrix shape manipulation, and some basic and more advanced matrix operations. The advanced section"}
{"label": true, "text": " is particularly interesting because it lists many useful functions in data analysis, like finding a covariance and eigenvalues and creating random normally distributed variables.Pros: Wide spectrum of related topics (Matlab, Python, NumPy, R, Julia), advancedlevel featuresCons: Bad readability, no PDF download Cheat Sheet 7: Numerical Analysis(http://hyperpolyglot.org/numericalanalysis)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik61024x477.png)(http://hyperpolyglot.org/numericalanalysis)This is the most comprehensive sheet on the list. Not only that includes sidetoside equivalents between MATLAB, R, NumPy, and Julia; and it also covers everything from functions and syntax, to loops and I/O. The most interesting and useful component is that certain lines like a function definition are given for MATLAB, R, and Julia, but not for NumPy because of the lack of that functionality. That makes it easy to compare and contrast and to find the best fit for a project(https://blog.finxter.com/howrealfreelancersearnmoneyin201910practicalpythonprojects/).Pros: Extremely comprehensiveCons: Not wellstructured, poor design, no PDF download Cheat Sheet 8: NumPy for R (and Splus) Users(http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/rnumpy.html)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik7.png)(http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/rnumpy.html)Although there are other comparison cheat sheets in this collection, this one lists some advanced features(https://blog.finxter.com/thetop18bestpythontricks/). As the title says, it is a comparison between R(and Splus) and NumPy. It is very detailed for each family of operations. For example, the sorting section provides eight ways to sort an array(https://blog.finxter.com/howtosortinoneline/). Some operations are not possible in both languages, so it is easy to find the right function. This is the only cheat sheet in the collection that provides detailed plots and graphs. Moreover, some advanced math and statistics were given, like differential equations and Fourier analysis.Pros: Advancedlevel, comparisonbased (R vs. NumPy), detailed, plots and graphsCons: Confusing, not focused Cheat Sheet 9: Scientific Python(https://ipgp.github.io/scientificpythoncheatsheet/?utmcontent=buffer7d821&utmmedium=social&utmsource=twitter.com&utmcampaign=buffernumpyimportnumpyasnp)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik81024x495.png)(https://ipgp.github.io/scientificpythoncheatsheet/?utmcontent=buffer7d821&utmmedium=social&utmsource=twitter.com&utmcampaign=buffernumpyimportnumpyasnp)This is not a NumPy specific sheet. It covers many Python data science topics, but also some Python basics. It is easily navigated through because of the contents given in the beginning. The NumPy section is comprehensive. It covers NumPy basics like the array properties and operations. Also, it contains an extensive list of math functions and linear algebra functions. Some of the useful linear algebra functions are finding inner and outer products and eigenvalues. Others are functions for rounding off and generating random (https://blog.finxter.com/pythonrandommodule/)variables.Pros: NumPy + science, maths, linear algebra, beautiful designCons: No PDF download, no visuals Cheat Sheet 10: Finxter NumPy(https://blog.finxter.com/numpycheatsheet/)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2019/10/grafik11.png)(https://blog.finxter.com/numpycheatsheet/)The Finxter (https://finxter.com/)cheat sheet is different from all the previously mentioned sheets because it\u2019s visually the clearest. It gives a detailed description of each function and lists the examples along with the outcome. The good thing about the visible outcome is that looking at it can help if you\u2019re unsure about the name of the function. Along with the cheat sheet, there is an accompanying video with further detai"}

The cheat sheet provides a twocolumn view, where the first column is NumPy, and the second column contains the xtensor equivalents. The sheet focuses on array initialization, reshaping, and slicing functions. Further, it continues with array manipulation like transpose or rotation functions. There are a lot of tensor operations, but the sheet is missing the descriptions. So, it\u2019s not always easily deducible what a certain function does.Pros: Only xtensor sheet, simple, comparisonbasedCons: Too specific for most coders Programmer Humor```Q: What is the objectoriented way to become wealthy?\ud83d\udcb0A: Inheritance.``` AttributionThis article is contributed by Finxter user Milica Cvetkovic.

If there is something you want to do with data, the chances are it will be possible in pandas. There are a vast number of possibilities within pandas, but most users find themselves using the same methods time after time. In this article, we compiled the best cheat sheets from across the web, which show you these core methods at a glance.The primary data structure in pandas is the\u00a0DataFrame(https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html)\u00a0used to store twodimensional data, along with a label for each corresponding column and row. If you are familiar with Excel spreadsheets or SQL databases, you can think of the DataFrame as being the pandas equivalent. If we take a single column from a DataFrame, we have onedimensional data. In pandas, this is called a\u00a0Series(https://pandas.pydata.org/pandasdocs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html). DataFrames can be created from scratch in your code, or loaded into Python from some external location, such as a CSV. This is often the first stage in any data analysis task. We can then do any number of things with our DataFrame in Pandas, including removing or editing values, filtering our data, or combining this DataFrame with another DataFrame. Each line of code in these cheat sheets lets you do something different with a DataFrame. Also, if you are coming from an Excel background, you will enjoy the performance pandas has to offer. After you get over the learning curve, you will be even more impressed with the functionality.Whether you are already familiar with pandas and are looking for a handy reference you can print out, or you have never used pandas and are looking for a resource to help you get a feel for the library there is a cheat sheet here for you! 1. The Most Comprehensive Cheat Sheet(https://pandas.pydata.org/PandasCheatSheet.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image31024x791.png)https://pandas.pydata.org/PandasCheatSheet.pdf(https://pandas.pydata.org/PandasCheatSheet.pdf)This one is from the pandas guys, so it makes sense that this is a comprehensive and inclusive cheat sheet. It covers the vast majority of what most pandas users will ever need to do to a DataFrame. Have you already used pandas for a little while? And are you looking to up your game? This is your cheat sheet! However, if you are newer to pandas and this cheat sheet is a bit overwhelming, don\u2019t worry! You definitely don\u2019t need to understand everything in this cheat sheet to get started. Instead, check out the next cheat sheet on this list. 2. The Beginner\u2019s Cheat Sheet(https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandascheatsheet/)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image101024x27"}
{"label": true, "text": "9.png)https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandascheatsheet/(https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandascheatsheet/)Dataquest is an online platform that teaches Data Science using interactive coding challenges. I love this cheat sheet they have put together. It has everything the pandas beginner needs to start using pandas right away in a friendly, neat list format. It covers the bare essentials of each stage in the data analysis process:Importing and exporting your data from an Excel file, CSV, HTML table or SQL databaseCleaning your data of any empty rows, changing data formats to allow for further analysis or renaming columnsFiltering your data or removing anomalous valuesDifferent ways to view the data and see it\u2019s dimensionsSelecting any combination of columns and rows within the DataFrame using loc and ilocUsing the .apply method to apply a formula to a particular column in the DataFrameCreating summary statistics for columns in the DataFrame. This includes the median, mean and standard deviationCombining DataFrames 3. The Excel User\u2019s Cheat Sheet(https://www.shanelynn.ie/usingpandasdataframecreatingeditingviewingdatainpython/)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image51024x541.png)https://www.shanelynn.ie/usingpandasdataframecreatingeditingviewingdatainpython/(https://www.shanelynn.ie/usingpandasdataframecreatingeditingviewingdatainpython/)Ok, this isn\u2019t quite a cheat sheet, it\u2019s more of an entire manifesto on the pandas DataFrame! If you have a little time on your hands, this will help you get your head around some of the theory behind DataFrames. It will take you all the way from loading in your trusty CSV from Microsoft Excel to viewing your data in Jupyter and handling the basics. The article finishes off by using the DataFrame to create a histogram and bar chart. For migrating your spreadsheet work from Excel to pandas, this is a fantastic guide. It will teach you how to perform many of the Excel basics in pandas. If you are also looking for how to perform the pandas equivalent of a VLOOKUP in Excel, check out Shane\u2019s\u00a0article(https://www.shanelynn.ie/mergejoindataframespythonpandasindex1/)\u00a0on the merge method. 4. The Most Beautiful Cheat Sheet(https://www.enthought.com/wpcontent/uploads/EnthoughtPythonPandasCheatSheets18v1.0.2.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image61024x699.png)https://www.enthought.com/wpcontent/uploads/EnthoughtPythonPandasCheatSheets18v1.0.2.pdf(https://www.enthought.com/wpcontent/uploads/EnthoughtPythonPandasCheatSheets18v1.0.2.pdf)If you\u2019re more of a visual learner, try this cheat sheet! Many common pandas tasks have intricate, colorcoded illustrations showing how the operation works. On page 3, there is a fantastic section called \u2018Computation with Series and DataFrames\u2019, which provides an intuitive explanation for how DataFrames work and shows how the index is used to align data when DataFrames are combined and how elementwise operations work in contrast to operations which work on each row or column. At 8 pages long, it\u2019s more of a booklet than a cheat sheet, but it can still make for a great resource!\u00a0 5. The Best Machine Learning Cheat Sheet(https://elitedatascience.com/pythoncheatsheet)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image71024x446.png)https://elitedatascience.com/pythoncheatsheet(https://elitedatascience.com/pythoncheatsheet)Much like the other cheat sheets, there is comprehensive coverage of the pandas basic in here. So, that includes filtering, sorting, importing, exploring, and combining DataFrames. However, where this Cheat Sheet differs is that it finishes off with an excellent section on\u00a0scikitlearn(https://scikitlearn.org/stable/), Python\u2019s machine learning library. In this section, the DataFrame is used to train a machine learning model. This cheat sheet will be perfect for anybody who is already familiar with machine learning and is transitioning from a "}

They have made cheat sheets on a bunch of the most popular Python libraries, which you can also check out\u00a0here(https://www.datacamp.com/community/datasciencecheatsheets). This cheat sheet nicely introduces the DataFrame, and then gives a quick overview of the basics. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t provide any information on the various ways you can combine DataFrames, but it does all fit on one page and looks great. So, if you are looking to stick a pandas cheat sheet on your bedroom wall and nail home the basics, this one might be for you! The cheat sheet finishes with a small section introducing NaN values, which come from NumPy. These indicate a null value and arise when the indices of two Series don\u2019t quite match up in this case. 7. The Best Statistics Cheat Sheet(https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/504/pandas%20dataframe%20notes.pdf)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/04/image91024x715.png)https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/504/pandas%20dataframe%20notes.pdf(https://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~stevel/504/pandas%20dataframe%20notes.pdf)While there aren\u2019t any pictures to be found in this sheet, it is an incredibly detailed set of notes on the pandas DataFrame. This cheat shines with its complete section on time series and statistics. There are methods for calculating covariance, correlation, and regression here. So, if you are using pandas for some advanced statistics or any kind of scientific work, this is going to be your cheat sheet. Where to go from here?For just automating a few tedious tasks at work, or using pandas to replace your crashing Excel spreadsheet, everything covered in these cheat sheets should be entirely sufficient for your purposes.\u00a0If you are looking to use pandas for Data Science, then you are only going to be limited by your knowledge of statistics and probability. This is the area that most people lack when they try to enter this field. I highly recommend checking out\u00a0Think Stats(https://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)\u00a0by Allen B Downey, which provides an introduction to statistics using Python.For those a little more advanced, looking to do some machine learning, you will want to start taking a look at the scikitlearn library. Data Camp has a great\u00a0cheat sheet(https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blogassets/ScikitLearnCheatSheetPython.pdf)\u00a0for this. You will also want to pick up a linear algebra textbook to understand the theory of machine learning. For something more practical, perhaps give the famous\u00a0Kaggle Titanic machine learning competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).Learning about pandas has many uses, and can be interesting simply for its own sake. However, Python is massively in demand right now, and for that reason, it is a highincome skill. At any given time, there are thousands of people searching for somebody to solve their problems with Python.

This is why I love cheat sheets \u2013 they can deliver complex information in little time.The cheat sheet divides the estimators into four classes:Classification,Clustering,Regression, andDimensionality reduction.Although those classes are not explored in depth, you will already know in which direction to look further. Of course, if you are already an experienced practitioner, the provided information may be too simplistic \u2013 but isn\u2019t this true for every cheat sheet?Build your own opinion now! (Do it.) Tensorflow Cheat Sheet(https://github.com/kailashahirwar/cheatsheetsai/blob/master/PDFs/Tensorflow.pdf) (Altoros)Although this cheat sheet is not the most sophisticated one, it is still valuable being one of the few TensorFlow cheat sheets out there.!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/06/image21743x1024.png)(https://github.com/kailashahirwar/cheatsheetsai/blob/master/PDFs/Tensorflow.pdf)You know TensorFlow, don\u2019t you? TensorFlow is one of the most popular Github projects and it\u2019s created by Google. Its machine learning API is tailored to deep learning on a heterogeneous computing environment (including GPUs). Nowadays, if you push in the field of deep learning, there is no way you can avoid TensorFlow.Get a first impression with this cheat sheet and then dive into Google\u2019s TensorFlow system(https://www.tensorflow.org/). By the way, you can also use Keras on top of TensorFlow as a more highlevel abstraction layer. Check out the Keras cheat sheet described earlier.The cheat sheet gives you hints aboutThe correct installation method,Helper functions,The name of some important functions in TensorFlow, andEstimators.To be frank, I would not recommend learning TensorFlow with this cheat sheet. Why? Because it is not focused on education. Yet, I felt obliged to include the link because there are no better alternatives for TensorFlow. If you know a better resource, please let me know. Machine Learning Test Cheat Sheet(https://www.cheatography.com/lulu0012/cheatsheets/testml/pdf/) (Cheatography)!(https://blog.finxter.com/wpcontent/uploads/2020/06/image221024x699.png)(https://www.cheatography.com/lulu0012/cheatsheets/testml/pdf/)Do you know cheatography? It\u2019s like Wikipedia for cheat sheets. Everybody can submit cheat sheets (usergenerated content).After going through most machine learning cheat sheets at Cheatography, I found that this one will be most helpful for most of our readers. It is a wellstructured overview of some important machine learning algorithms.It shows you that there are three common problems in machine learning: regression, clustering, and classification.It gives you the general steps for training a model.Finally, it glances over a collection of specific algorithms that you should know when starting out in the field of machine learning. Those are logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, kmeans, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbors, and support vector machines.I know that it is only a first dip into the ocean. But if you are a beginner or intermediate machine learning practitioner, this may just be what you have looked for.
